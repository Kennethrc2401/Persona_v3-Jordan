    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p>Jordan is an influential performer. He sometimes has a very busy schedule but does his best to put a lot of time into teaching adults about music.
<br />
<br />
He charges $70 per hour for music lessons. He wants to be matched with beginner students and advanced students who are ready to put in at least 10 hours of practice per week. The commissions charged by the site have to be relatively small and the benefits of scheduling through the site must be considerable, otherwise he will just tell his students to pay him directly. </p>
